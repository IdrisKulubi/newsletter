- Inactive (<10% open rate)

**Features:**
- Pie chart distribution
- Engagement metrics by segment
- Optimal send time analysis
- AI-powered insights and recommendations

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Client-side caching**: 5-minute TTL for dashboard data
- **Server-side caching**: Performance service with tenant-specific cache
- **Cache invalidation**: Automatic clearing on data updates

### Large Dataset Handling
- **Batch processing**: Events processed in batches of 1000
- **Pre-aggregated metrics**: Daily analytics for faster queries
- **Indexed queries**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- **Lazy loading**: Components load data as needed

### Real-time Updates
- **Auto-refresh**: Dashboard updates every 5 minutes
- **Manual refresh**: User-triggered refresh with loading states
- **Optimistic updates**: Immediate UI updates with background sync

## Data Flow

```
User Action → Server Action → Analytics Service → Database
                ↓
Performance Service → Cache → Component State → UI Update
```

### Key Services

#### `AnalyticsService`
Core service for analytics operations:
- Event recording (single and batch)
- Dashboard data generation
- Campaign report generation
- Nightly metric aggregation

#### `AnalyticsPerformanceService`
Performance-optimized service for large datasets:
- Cached data retrieval
- Batch event processing
- Optimized queries with pre-aggregated data
- Memory-efficient operations

## Testing

### Integration Tests
- **analytics-basic.test.ts**: Core functionality and caching
- **analytics-performance.test.ts**: Performance optimizations
- **analytics-dashboard.test.ts**: UI component interactions

### Test Coverage
- Caching mechanisms
- Error handling
- Performance characteristics
- Data integrity
- Large dataset processing

## Usage Examples

### Basic Dashboard
```tsx
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from '@/components/analytics';

export default function AnalyticsPage() {
  return <AnalyticsDashboard />;
}
```

### Campaign Report
```tsx
import { CampaignReportComponent } from '@/components/analytics';

export default function CampaignReport({ params }) {
  return <CampaignReportComponent campaignId={params.id} />;
}
```

### Custom Date Range
```tsx
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from '@/components/analytics';

const customRange = {
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-31'),
};

<AnalyticsDashboard initialData={data} />
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Database connection for analytics queries
- Redis connection for caching
- Rate limiting configurations

### Performance Tuning
- Adjust `BATCH_SIZE` in AnalyticsPerformanceService
- Modify `CACHE_TTL` for different caching strategies
- Configure auto-refresh intervals
